\title{
   Generalized Sensitivity Analysis for Weighted Rank Statistics in Block Designs
}
\description{
  Uses a weighted rank statistic to perform a sensitivity analysis for an I x J observational block design in which each of I blocks contain J individuals, some of whom are treated individuals and others are controls.
}
\usage{
gwgtRank(y, z, phi = "u868", phifunc = NULL, gamma = 1, detail=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{y}{
 A matrix or data frame of responses with I rows and J columns.  An error will result if y contains NAs.
}
\item{z}{
 A matrix or data frame of treatment indicators with I rows and J columns.  In z, the ith row and jth column is a 1 if this individual is treated, or a 0 if this individual is a control.  If a row of z contains J ones or J zeros, that block will be removed from further computations as there is no one to compare, and a warning will appear.  An error will result if z contains NAs.
}
  \item{phi}{
     The weight function to be applied to the ranks of the within block ranges.  The options are: (i) "wilc" for the stratified Wilcoxon test, which gives every block the same weight, (ii) "quade" which ranks the within block ranges from 1 to I, and is closely related to Quade's (1979) statistic; see also Tardif (1987), (iii) "u868" based on Rosenbaum (2011), (iv) u878 based on Rosenbaum (2011).  Note that phi is ignored if phifunc is not NULL.
}
  \item{phifunc}{ If not NULL, a user specified weight function for the ranks of the within block ranges.  The function should map [0,1] into [0,1].  The function is applied to the ranks divided by the sample size.  See the example.
}
  \item{gamma}{
   A single number greater than or equal to 1.  gamma is the sensitivity parameter.  Two individuals with the same observed covariates may differ in their odds of treatment by at most a factor of gamma; see Rosenbaum (1987; 2017, Chapter 9).
}
  \item{detail}{
   If detail=FALSE, then brief output is given, similar to that provided by wgtRank().  In both cases, the asymptotically separable approximation of Gastwirth et al. (2000) is used. If detail=TRUE, then the separable approximation is compared with a bound in Rosenbaum (2018), and the output from the senstrat package is given.  For moderate J and large I, the bound is likely to agree exactly with the separable approximation.
}
}
\details{
The function gwgtRank()
differs from wgtRank() in that wgtRank requires one treated individual and J-1 controls,
whereas gwgtRank permits 1 to J-1 treated indivuals with the rest as controls.

This function uses the senstrat() function in the senstrat package to perform the calculations.

To test in the lower tail -- to test against the alternative that treated responses are lower than control responses, apply the function to -y.  For a two-sided test, do both one-sided tests and apply the Bonferroni inequality, doubling the smaller of the two one-sided P-value bounds; see Cox (1977, Section 4.2).
}
\value{
 \item{pval }{Upper bound on the one-sided P-value when testing
 the null hypothesis of no treatment effect against the alternative hypothesis that treated responses are higher than control responses.}
 \item{detail }{Details of the computation of pval: the standardized deviate, the test statistic, its null expectation, its null variance and the value of gamma.}

An alternative approach avoids rank tests and uses weighted M-statistics instead, as in the sensitivitymw package and Rosenbaum (2014).  However, Bahadur efficiency calculations are available for weighted rank statistics; see Rosenbaum (2024).
