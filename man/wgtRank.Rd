\title{
   Sensitivity Analysis for Weighted Rank Statistics in Block Designs
}
\description{
  Uses a weighted rank statistic to perform a sensitivity analysis for an I x J observational block design in which each of I blocks contains one treated individual and J-1 controls.
}
\usage{
wgtRank(y, phi = "u868", phifunc = NULL, gamma = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{y}{
 A matrix or data frame with I rows and J columns.  Column 1 contains the response of the treated individuals and columns 2 throught J contain the responses of controls in the same block.  A error will result if y contains NAs.
}
  \item{phi}{
     The weight function to be applied to the ranks of the within block ranges.  The options are: (i) "wilc" for the stratified Wilcoxon test, which gives every block the same weight, (ii) "quade" which ranks the within block ranges from 1 to I, and is closely related to Quade's (1979) statistic; see also Tardif (1987), (iii) "u868" based on Rosenbaum (2011), (iv) u878 based on Rosenbaum (2011).  Note that phi is ignored if phifunc is not NULL.
}
  \item{phifunc}{ If not NULL, a user specified weight function for the ranks of the within block rates.  The function should map [0,1] into [0,1].  The function is applied to the ranks divided by the sample size.  See the example.
}
  \item{gamma}{
   A single number greater than or equal to 1.  gamma is the sensitivity parameter.  Two individuals with the same observed covariates may differ in their odds of treatment by at most a factor of gamma; see Rosenbaum (1987; 2017, Chapter 9).
}
}
\details{
This method is developed and evaluated in Rosenbaum (2022).

To test in the lower tail -- to test against the alternative that treated responses are lower than control responses, apply the function to -y.  For a two-sided test, do both one-sided tests and apply the Bonferroni inequality, doubling the smaller of the two one-sided P-value bounds; see Cox (1977, Section 4.2).
}
\value{
 \item{pval }{Upper bound on the one-sided P-value when testing
 the null hypothesis of no treatment effect against the alternative hypothesis that treated responses are higher than control responses.}
 \item{detail }{Details of the computation of pval: the standardized deviate, the test statistic, its null expectation, its null variance and the value of gamma.}

\note{
The computations use the separable approximation discussed in Gastwirth et al. (2000) and Rosenbaum (2018).  Compare with the method in Rosenbaum (2014) and the R package sensitivitymw.
}

\seealso{
An alternative approach avoids rank tests and uses weighted M-statistics instead, as in the sensitivitymw package and Rosenbaum (2014).  However, Bahadur efficiency calculations are available for weighted rank statistics; see Rosenbaum (2022).
